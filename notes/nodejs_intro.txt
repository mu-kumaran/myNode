Node.js is a server-side platform
Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009

Node.js is an open source,
cross-platform runtime environment
for developing server-side and networking applications.

Node.js applications are written in JavaScript,
and can be run within the Node.js runtime on
OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules
which simplifies the development of web applications
using Node.js to a great extent.

Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library

Features of Node.js
=========================


Asynchronous and Event Driven −
All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking.
It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data.
The server moves to the next API after calling it and
a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js
helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine,
Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

Single Threaded but Highly Scalable −
Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping.

Event mechanism helps the server to respond
in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed
to traditional servers

which create limited threads to handle requests.
Node.js uses a single threaded program and
the same program can provide service to a much
larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.

No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data.
These applications simply output the data in chunks.

License − Node.js is released under the MIT license
